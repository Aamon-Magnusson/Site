This page will showcase some things that I have done or made that I am proud of.
Not all are technical, just whatever comes to mind.

# `DWM`

I have spent a fairly significant amount of time setting up my `DWM` config, which can be found on [Github](http://github.aamon.xyz/).
Through it I have taken the time to learn Git, patching, bash scripting, and customization within the FOSS space.
While `DWM` is window manager, I have created a desktop environment, to an extent.
Nearly everything that I need to make a bare Arch Linux install usable is installed through one script.

By no means is this impressive to many people, or really impressive at all, I am just proud of the work I've put into my Linux desktop through `DWM`.

# Running a marathon

In October 2018 I ran a full marathon.
All 42.2 kms (26.2 miles).
At the time I was 17.

This was in the middle of my grade 12 cross country season.
So I was in great shape.
(Still definitely not in enough shape to run a marathon)
I was planning on running a 5:00 min/km pace through the marathon.
I started off great running 4:45 min/km for the first 25~30 kms.

I felt strong....
Until I didn't.

The last 10 kms were some of the most physically difficult steps I've taken.
I went between walking, to pausing to snack, to short jogs for all of 10 steps.
The only thing getting me through that race was the thought of having an A&W burger afterwards.

I eventually finished the marathon after 3 hours and 50 minutes, which stands as my person PB.

I do plan on improving on this, as I also plan of training for Ironman style events.
I have been swimming, running, and increasing riding for some time.
I plan on running a half Ironman this upcoming summer, getting me back in the pool, on my feet, and pointing my riding into more exercise than just trails.
