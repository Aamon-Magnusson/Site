This page will showcase some things that I have done or made that I am proud of.
Not all are technical, just whatever comes to mind.

## `DWM`

I have spent a fairly significant amount of time setting up my `DWM` config, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm).
Through it I have taken the time to learn Git, patching, bash scripting, and customization within the FOSS space.
While `DWM` is window manager, I have created a desktop environment, to an extent.
Nearly everything that I need to make a bare Arch Linux install usable is installed through one script.

By no means is this impressive to many people, or really impressive at all, I am just proud of the work I've put into my Linux desktop through `DWM`.
