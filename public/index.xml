      <description>Hello,
I&amp;rsquo;m Aamon.
I work as a cyber security analyst. Within that I work as a pentester, SOC analyst, and what ever else I&amp;rsquo;m given.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also gained an interest into Gnu/Linux (That is that last time I will add the Gnu on this site), and open source software. I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love the customization, and terminal use, that much FOSS software provides. With that I use Neovim, and DWM as my main preferred pieces of software.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Aamon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a cyber security analyst.
Within that I work as a pentester, SOC analyst, and what ever else I&amp;rsquo;m given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also gained an interest into Gnu/Linux (That is that last time I will add the Gnu on this site), and open source software.
I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love the customization, and terminal use, that much FOSS software provides.
With that I use Neovim, and DWM as my main preferred pieces of software.
(I will likely try to write something about my preferred workflow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also familiar with Windows.
(Thanks Microsoft for not making that optional :|)
Powertoys is an amazing collection of software to make Windows that much more usable.
(Also it&amp;rsquo;s FOSS :))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of tech, I love riding, and working on bikes.
I currently own 5 bikes, ranging from a fixed gear, to a IBIS Ripmo AF (Full suspension mountain bike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this site I will write about whatever I decide to.
Some may be guides for things that I know, or that I just learned.
This will help me ingrain the skills I have and learn.
Others may be recipes that I want to keep a hold of.
But in total this is largely to get me to write, which is far from one of my highlighted skills.
I tend to think of myself as a technical person, and this may help me branch out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt many will get even here, but thanks for reading, and please reach out to give any guidance or recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
