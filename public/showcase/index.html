<h1 id="dwm"><code>DWM</code><a href="#dwm" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I have spent a fairly significant amount of time setting up my <code>DWM</code> config, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/AamonDwm">Github</a>.
Through it I have taken the time to learn Git, patching, bash scripting, and customization within the FOSS space.
While <code>DWM</code> is window manager, I have created a desktop environment, to an extent.
Nearly everything that I need to make a bare Arch Linux install usable is installed through one script.</p>
<p>By no means is this impressive to many people, or really impressive at all, I am just proud of the work I&rsquo;ve put into my Linux desktop through <code>DWM</code>.</p>

<h1 id="running-a-marathon">Running a marathon<a href="#running-a-marathon" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>In October 2018 I ran a full marathon.
All 42.2 kms (26.2 miles).
At the time I was 17.</p>
<p>This was in the middle of my grade 12 cross country season.
So I was in great shape.
(Still definitely not in enough shape to run a marathon)
I was planning on running a 5:00 min/km pace through the marathon.
I started off great running 4:45 min/km for the first 25~30 kms.</p>
<p>I felt strong&hellip;.
Until I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The last 10 kms were some of the most physically difficult steps I&rsquo;ve taken.
I went between walking, to pausing to snack, to short jogs for all of 10 steps.
The only thing getting me through that race was the thought of having an A&amp;W burger afterwards.</p>
<p>I eventually finished the marathon after 3 hours and 50 minutes, which stands as my person PB.</p>
<p>I do plan on improving on this, as I also plan of training for Ironman style events.
I have been swimming, running, and increasing riding for some time.
I plan on running a half Ironman this upcoming summer, getting me back in the pool, on my feet, and pointing my riding into more exercise than just trails.</p>
